    "Ans: Grid search CV is a technique used in machine learning to search and find the optimal combination of hyperparameters for a given model. It systematically explores a predefined set of hyperparameter values, creating a “grid” of possible combinations1. The parameters of the estimator used to apply these methods are optimized by cross-validated grid-search over a parameter grid2."

    "Ans: Data leakage refers to a mistake made by the creator of a machine learning model in which they accidentally share information between the test and training data-sets4. This additional information can allow the model to learn or know something that it otherwise would not know and in turn invalidate the estimated performance of the mode being constructed5. For example, if a model is trained to predict whether a patient has a certain disease based on their symptoms, but the training data also includes information about the patient’s diagnosis, then the model may simply learn to predict the diagnosis rather than actually using the symptoms to make its predictions.\n",

This can include techniques such as splitting the data into training and test sets before performing any preprocessing or feature engineering, and ensuring that any preprocessing or feature engineering steps are performed independently on the training and test sets."

The number of correct and incorrect predictions are summarized with count values and broken down by each class6.

It gives you insight not only into the errors being made by your classifier but more importantly the types of errors that are being made6."

Precision is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions, while recall is the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances7. In other words, precision measures how many of the positive predictions made by the model are actually correct, while recall measures how many of the actual positive instances were correctly identified by the model."
